ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @TerkaSlan, currently a Ph.D. candidate at Faculty of Informatics, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic

### Current projects
1) Study of machine learning as applied to database management, specifically to similarity searching on complex data
2) Cooperation w/ CERIT-SC (Masaryk University) and CzechGlobe on estimation of vegetation parameters to help analyze the health of forests and crops.

### Interests
Iâ€™m interested in everything machine learning related, specifically application of ML to data processing and database management.
If you feel like collaborating on topics related to similarity searching, complex data management, learned indexing, or any other field loosely related, hit me up :)
